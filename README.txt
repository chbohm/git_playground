Create new branch
1- Do some commits there
2- Meanwhile main keeps growing
3- You do more commits and you decide you are done
4- Code review!
5- More changes
6- Once the review is ok we melt all the commits in one single commit (squash)

7-When we consider this should be merged into /main we do:
	a- Rebase the branch on top of main 
	b- we go to main and we merge our branch
